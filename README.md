## Rough Schedule
### INTRO
- Move a sprite
- Move a sprite on a map
- Move a sprite on a map with gravity and collision detection
### BREAK
- Randomly generate a map on a never-ending loop
- Make the map dangerous/ cause a game over
- Make an obnoxiously-repetitive musical loop
### BREAK
- Motivation: carrot (keeping score) and stick (oncoming freight train)
- Add just enough animation to impress time travelers from 1981
- Make the game more difficult as you progress (yâ€™know, like real games)
